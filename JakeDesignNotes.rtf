\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Jake's Design Requests:
\b0 \
\
1. The important thing to note is ease. Casting directors and agents don't want to click a lot or maneuver through too much on an actors website. Go to it, resume, headshot, reel, and a sense of what you're about. \
\
2. I figure there can be 5 tabs (or sections) altogether - A Homepage, News, Gallery, Reel, and Contact.\
\
3. 
\f1\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I like a homepage that is not too busy. You'll see in the websites I sent you that that is the case with most of them. But maybe a traditional "Homepage" is not the best route - again, it just needs to be very clean, comprehensive, and focused.\'a0\cb1 \
\
4. Should be \cb3 easy to navigate - an interested casting director or agent needs to go to my website and have quick access to what I look like, who I am, what I've done, and how to contact me. \
\
5. My resume needs to be seen and also have an option for a downloadable PDF.\'a0\
\
6. My reel ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://vimeo.com/119150360"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 https://vimeo.com/119150360}}) needs to be on the page, but not on auto-play.\'a0\
\
7. Relevant links - \
	IMDB - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932053/\
	Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/jake.williamson.10\
	Twitter - https://twitter.com/JWilliamsonofa\
	Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/jwillinyc/\
	Youtube - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/user/WickedFiyero"}}{\fldrslt https://www.youtube.com/user/WickedFiyero}}\
\
8.  I sort of see the first page having my picture with a caption\'a0"Hey. I'm Jake.\'a0\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300
\cf2 ... I'll be referring to myself in third person from here on out."\
\
	9. I need a 'Posts' section called Recent, with the following blog posts in it:\
\
		Look out, son! Jake is back in NYC after his regional gig. He's looking forward to starting his production company Dead Pan Alley. The first short film they have produced (which Jake is in as well), GAME NIGHT, is in post-production currently. Look for it soon, yo!\'a0\
