# Wordpress Lab

Now that we've learned a little bit about Wordpress, we're going to make a website for **Brian**!

Brian is a real person - he's a photographer that's looking to rebrand himself as a photojournalist. This means a new website that pivots him away from wedding and event photography, and towards serious, news-focused work!

In this repo, you'll find a `resources` folder with a single document in it. It contains instructions for how Brian would like his site to look and function, as well as a link to a Google Drive folder with his photography in it.

You might notice that Brian's requests are pretty minimal - that's because he's not a designer, and doesn't have an established brand. He's counting on you to use your own creativity and problem solving skills to fill in the blanks with something that stands out!

1. Study the included materials - Brian's assets, and his design requests. 
1. Find a theme that you think will fit the bill, or hack at the one pre-installed by Wordpress.
1. Set up as much of the site as you can in the time you have. Keep in mind that Brian is non-technical, and will want to edit this site himself - as a result, you should stay away from hardcoded pages, or large chuncks of HTML in the admin section. Work **with** Wordpress to maintain non-techinical usability.
1. Host your wordpress instance on [Heroku](https://ksylvest.com/posts/2014-05-02/deploying-wordpress-to-heroku) or your own hosting account so that Brian can see it. I suggest using [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) to easily move your WP instance from one host to another.

After you're done, Brian will look at everyone's submissions. If he likes your site, he'll use it, and you'll be able to add a new project to your portfolio!

## Assignment

Submit a link to your live WP instance. 

You are not expected to deliver a fully-functional finished product - all I want is **a live Wordpress instance that has enough of Brian's requests that you can demo it to him**. If your design is picked, you may be able to continue your work with the site afterwards.
