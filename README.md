# Wordpress Lab

Now that we've learned a little bit about Wordpress, we're going to make a real website for [Jake](jakewilliamson.squarespace.com)

Jake is a real person - he's an actor in New York who's appeared in multiple films, stage plays, and TV shows, including Celebrity Ghost stories - spooky!

Jake's one fatal flaw? His website sucks. He wishes it looked more like these:

- <http://www.grace-rao.com> 
- <http://www.katiewieland.com> 
- <http://www.jeffreyomura.com>

What Jake would really like is a brand new Wordpress site that he can edit himself. So we're going to make some options for him! To start:

1. Study the included materials - Jake's assets, and his design requests. Also note the above websites Jake likes.
1. Use the included template as a starting point, and customize it to meet Jake's specifications.
1. Submit your updated template and DB export so it can be tested in action.

- Resume Page
- Gallery Page
- Reel Page (videos)
- Contact Page
- About Page (could be homepage)


BONUS: Host it on your own LIVE wordpress instance so that Jake can check it out himself.

After you're done, Jake will look at everyone's submissions. If he likes one, he'll use it for his site, and you'll be able to add a new project to your portfolio!
