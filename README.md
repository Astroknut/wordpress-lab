# Wordpress Lab

Now that we've learned a little bit about Wordpress, we're going to make a real website for Robyn.

Robyn is a real person - she's created multiple business, including Just4MyPet and Bachelorette Bitches. Her latest venture is Poop Tulips - artificially-poop-scented flowers you can send to someone who deserves it. 


What Robyn would really like is a brand new Wordpress site that she can edit herself. So we're going to make some options for her! To start:

1. Study the included materials - Robyn's assets, and her design requests. 
1. Use the included template as a starting point, and customize it to meet Robyn's specifications.
1. Robyn would like to use the [WooCommerce Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) to sell her products (don't get too in the weeds with this install - ensure that it works and save things like tax table configuration for 'sprint 2').
1. Host your wordpress instance on [Heroku](https://ksylvest.com/posts/2014-05-02/deploying-wordpress-to-heroku) or your own hosting account so that Robyn can see it. I suggest using [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) to easily move your WP instance from one host to another.


After you're done, Robyn will look at everyone's submissions. If she likes one, she'll use it, and you'll be able to add a new project to your portfolio!

## Assignment

Submit a link to your live WP instance. 

You are not expected to deliver a fully-functional finished product - all I want is **a live Wordpress instance that has enough of Robyn's request that you can demo it to her**. If your design is picked, you may be able to continue your work with the site afterwards.
